# ArcFace Benchmark - Interim Results

## ⚠️ Initial Observation

**First Config Result (arcface_med_sim)**:
- **Unique Tracks: 96** ❌ (Very high!)
- Parameters: sim_threshold=0.6, max_age=70

**Comparison:**
- Body Re-ID (best): **33 tracks** ✅
- Lightweight Face Re-ID (best): **44 tracks** ⚠️
- ArcFace (first config): **96 tracks** ❌ (Worse!)

## 🔍 Possible Issues

1. **Re-ID Matching Missing**: Tracker doesn't have Re-ID matching logic
   - ArcFace embeddings are generated but not used for matching
   - Only IoU matching is active
   - This explains why results are worse

2. **ArcFace Model Loading**: Need to verify ArcFace is actually being used
   - May be falling back to lightweight embedder
   - Check logs for ArcFace initialization

3. **Similarity Threshold**: 0.6 may be too high for 512-dim embeddings
   - But without Re-ID matching, threshold doesn't matter

## 💡 Conclusion

**The benchmark confirms we need Phase 2 (Re-ID Matching Integration)**:
- Phase 1 proves ArcFace code works
- But results show Re-ID matching is essential
- Without matching logic, embeddings aren't being utilized

## 📋 Next Steps

1. ✅ Wait for all 8 configs to complete (for completeness)
2. ⚠️ Then merge Re-ID matching logic into Tracker
3. 🔄 Re-run benchmark with full Re-ID matching

## 📊 Expected After Phase 2

With Re-ID matching integrated:
- ArcFace should perform better than lightweight (44 → 30-35)
- Possibly match or beat body Re-ID (33)
