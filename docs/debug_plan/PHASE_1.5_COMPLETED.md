# Phase 1.5: Model Research & Benchmarking - COMPLETED ✅

## 📋 Summary

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Branch**: phase-1.5-model-research (to be merged)  
**Date**: 2024

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. YOLOv8n Benchmark Testing ✅

**Script Created**: `src/scripts/benchmark_yolov8.py`

**Results**:
- ✅ CPU Performance: 18.91 ms (~52.89 FPS)
- ✅ MPS Performance: 18.69 ms (~53.51 FPS)  
- ✅ MPS is 1.01x faster than CPU
- ✅ Excellent inference speed

**Recommendation**: Use MPS device for all inference operations ✅

---

### 2. Demographics Models Research ✅

**Models Considered**:
1. ✅ FairFace (PyTorch) - Good accuracy, recommended
2. ✅ Age-Gender Net - Lightweight alternative
3. ✅ Custom models - Future consideration

**Decision**: 
- Use FairFace or similar for initial implementation
- Re-evaluate after testing on actual data
- Focus on person detection first, demographics can be refined later

---

### 3. Performance Targets Set ✅

**Detection Module**:
- Initial target: 5+ FPS per channel
- Optimization goal: 10+ FPS per channel
- Accuracy target: 85%+
- Stretch goal: 10+ FPS, 90% accuracy

**Overall System**:
- Single channel: 5-10 FPS
- Four channels: 2-5 FPS per channel
- Memory: < 4GB
- Latency: < 200ms per frame
