**Date**: 2024  
**Version**: 1.0 → 2.0  
**Status**: ✅ Revised and Ready

---

## 🔄 Key Changes Made

### 1. Model Selection Change

**Before**: YOLOv9  
**After**: YOLOv8n

**Rationale**:
- YOLOv9 too new, may have MPS compatibility issues
- YOLOv8n has proven MPS support
- Better documented and tested
- Nano version is lightweight and fast

**Impact**: Low risk, better compatibility

---

### 2. Timeline Extension

**Before**: 9 weeks  
**After**: 16 weeks (with buffer)

**Rationale**:
- More realistic for comprehensive development
- Accounts for integration challenges
- Allows time for optimization
- Reduces timeline pressure

**Phases Breakdown**:
- Phase 1: Week 1 (Setup)
- Phase 1.5: Week 1-2 ⭐ NEW (Model Research)
- Phase 2: Week 1-3 (Camera Integration)
- Phase 3: Week 3-5 (Detection)
- Phase 3.5: Week 5 (Video Testing)
- Phase 4-6: Week 6-12 (Full Pipeline)
- Phase 7: Week 12-14 (Live Camera)
- Phase 8-9: Week 14-16 (Optimization)

---

### 3. Added Phase 1.5: Model Research ⭐ NEW

**Purpose**: Research and benchmark models early

**Tasks**:
- Research demographics models
- Test on sample data
- Benchmark YOLOv8n performance
- Set realistic targets

**Benefits**:
- Early discovery of issues
- Better planning
- Adjust expectations before deep development

---

### 4. Adjusted Success Criteria

**Before** (Optimistic):
- 10+ FPS target
- 90%+ accuracy targets
- 80% demographics accuracy

**After** (Realistic):
- Initial: 5+ FPS
- Optimize to: 10+ FPS
- Detection accuracy: 85% (stretch: 90%)
- Tracking consistency: 80% (stretch: 90%)
- Demographics: 70% (stretch: 80%)

**Rationale**: Start with achievable targets, optimize later

---

### 5. Enhanced Testing Strategy

**Added Requirements**:
- Phase 3.5: Mandatory video file testing
- Cannot proceed to live camera without passing video tests
- Specific checklist before live integration
- Code coverage requirements (80%)

---

### 6. Performance Targets - Phased Approach

**Initial Performance** (Acceptable):
- 5+ FPS per channel
- Basic functionality works
- Memory usage < 4GB

**Optimized Performance** (Target):
- 10+ FPS per channel
- All features working smoothly
- Optimized resource usage
